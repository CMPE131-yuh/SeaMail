Our application is an email messaging application that allows users to message one another. For our application, users must register with their persona/ private information such as their email addresses and passwords. Because we are dealing with personal and private information of our user clients, we have certain responsibilities that we must enforce in order to preserve the privacy and safety of our clients. Some of these ethical and professional responsibilities include not selling client data to third party companies, not leaking contents of clients message exchanges, and  being accessible to all users, regardless of disabilities or other limitations. Our application should also be designed with user-friendly interfaces that are easy to navigate. Applications like ours and other engineering solutions greatly influence our world globally, economically, environmentally, and in the context of our society. Globally, engineering solutions play a crucial role in global development by creating new technologies and improving existing ones that make life easier and more efficient throughout countries around the world. Economically, engineering solutions drive economic growth by creating new industries and improving existing ones, creating jobs, and boosting productivity. They also increase efficiency, reduce costs, and improve product quality, which benefits both producers and consumers. Environmentally,  Engineering solutions have both positive and negative environmental impacts. On the one hand, they can help reduce pollution, conserve natural resources, and mitigate climate change. On the other hand, they can also contribute to environmental degradation if not designed and implemented with sustainability in mind. This reason is why we need to find a balance between the spectrum, where we can limit the negative impacts while focusing on ways we can enhance the positive effects. When considering engineering’s impact on society, engineering solutions have a significant impact on society, improving quality of life, increasing access to resources, and enabling new forms of communication and entertainment. However, they also raise ethical concerns, such as privacy, safety, and social inequality. It is important to consider the potential societal impacts of engineering solutions and address these concerns through responsible design and implementation.
